# Merlin: AI-Powered News Generator
Merlin is an AI-powered tool that fetches and summarizes news articles and creates engaging social media posts. It combines a Node.js backend for fetching news content and a Streamlit frontend for generating responses. The project integrates with APIs like Vectara and NewsAPI to provide an interactive and dynamic experience.

Features
1. Fetch the latest news articles using NewsAPI.
2. Summarize articles and provide concise insights using AI tools.
3. Generate creative social media posts for platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.
4. Simple and user-friendly UI powered by Streamlit.

# How to Use Merlin:
1. What to Ask Merlin : Merlin works best when you ask specific and relevant questions about news topics. It will fetch, summarize, and generate posts based on the topic you input.

2. Do's:  
"Get news about AI trends."  
"Fetch the latest articles on climate change."  
"Summarize news about Shah Rukh Khan."  

3. Don'ts:  
Avoid questions like:
"How are you?"  
"Whatâ€™s the weather today?"  
"Tell me a joke."  
These will cause Merlin to overthink and fail to provide accurate results. Keep your questions focused on news-related topics.
